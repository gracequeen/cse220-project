# cse220-project
This workload comes from: https://github.com/wangkuiwu/datastructs_and_algorithm/tree/master/source/graph/floyd/udg/c

1. floyd-matrix-udg.c -- the original workload
2. fload-matrix-udg.rv -- the binary generated by myself for refence
3. floyd-report.txt -- execution report comeing from report.pl
4. run-floyd.sh -- the sub-script to run the workload with ESESC
5. total-floyd.sh -- all the commands needed to view the final result, the exact file for instructors to repeat the experiment

## Compile and Run
1. Please put all the files in /build/release/run/.
2. Run this script and sit and wait. Final report will be printed to screen.
```bash
./total-floyd.sh
```

## Side Notes:
1. Please be patient. The logged time from the report is here for reference:
%Sim Time (s) 672.969 Exe  336.050 ms Sim (1700MHz); Host Computer parameters: 3.5 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5 with 3.5 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5
2. I added sudo in my script, since there's some access control issue when I share files between the virtual machine and host. I've add user into vbox group still the issue is not fully resolved. \item low IPC: 0.64; instruction count: 362,993,035 - 362,993,061; Changing the input graph affects this result quite a lot.
